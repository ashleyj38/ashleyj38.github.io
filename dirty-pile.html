        <h6 class="text-center">Background</h6>
        <p class="lead">In a brief meeting with the business owner, I was able to gather all of the requirements needed for this laundry service order form. In the meeting, we discussed his list desired fields &amp; the requirement of each, service options &amp; pricing, and payment options.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="lead">Although small in theory, forms can be some of the hardest interfaces to design for the best user experience. Based on the meeting with the client, there were a number of required fields that needed to be filled out. My goal was to create a form including these fields that was not frustrating for the user and easy to manipulate for both desktop and mobile. I also wanted to make all charges and pricing clear as the user filled out their request and give the user some sense of control in their preferences.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="lead">Due to the length of this form, I first divided the form into sections of relevant information. I included styled radio buttons instead of the default to add some visual appeal to the form. I also added a calculation aspect to the form to give clear visibility into the cost of the service.</p>
